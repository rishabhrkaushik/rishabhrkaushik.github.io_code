		"projectDesc": {
			"P1": "Designed and Build a full fledged ATE for testing of Circuit Breakers. The project involved variouis stations to perform Electrical and Mechanical test on the CB's. PLC along with actuators took care of movement of CB from one station to another. Parallel stations and testing was used to achieve the required throughput. PXI chasis was used alogn with measuring and powering instruments to perform the test, record the result and generate the result.",
